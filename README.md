# SIQ-IHM-DEMO

This project was created as a demonstration for my students in the university of Blida, it is only available publicaly on Github so they can have access to it.

The project was inspired from the following playlist on youtube

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6omp69kEJz0P7gL0MrRkz9DRNg2KMJtr

I tried to make the code cleaner than what they did on this youtube playlist

Most probably there will a lot of changes on this demo project in the futur semesters
